    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>The Long Eaton Judo Club was founded in 1961 and began when a group of local people attended a Judo beginner’s course at Derby Road School in Long Eaton. Initially there were 8, they all seemed to enjoy themselves so one of the group, Stuart Arundel suggested they all put in half a crown a week to purchase a mat area. It cost £40, this an achievement in itself and was kept and used in the Canteen area of Chambers, a local box packaging company in Toton. This small beginning was the start of the Long Eaton Judo Club. They then appointed a Secretary, Stuart who also enrolled himself on a coaching course. A further beginner’s course was set up by the newly created club with the help of local people who were already involved in the sport of Judo. This course attracted a gentleman named Ray Hawkins, Ray as some of you will know became one of the most influential members of our club.</p>
    
    <p>It soon became apparent that practicing judo in a canteen and getting changed behind dusty machinery was far from ideal so the Long Eaton Boys Club came to our aid and kindly agreed to rent some land namely the present day site of Kirkfields, Off Cross Street. This was the start of a very long and happy relation between Long Eaton Judo Club and The Boys Club which remains to this day. The club was starting to get well established, with some judokas’ really moving up the grades, with Ray achieving his Dan grade in 1969, also at this time Ray had taken over as Secretary and was now the club coach. It soon became apparent that having a permanent mat area would greatly benefit the members so the committee once again approached the Boys Club for help who kindly provided the piece of land next to the club for lease, the only problem was there was no building on it!. This eventually came in the form a wooden bungalow sourced from Ilkeston, and kindly transported for free by local builder Ralph Marks.</p>
    
    <p>On September 11th 1971 the wooden bungalow was erected and Long Eaton Judo club moved into its new premises. This was only made possible by the hard work and dedication of many of its volunteers.</p>
    
    <p>In 1981 work began to double the size of the premises once more, this by adding a further purpose built building on adjoining land which in turn became the new mat area.  Members old and new devoted many hours to achieve this, but Ray would often be seen working late and tirelessly on his own. One year later the expansion was complete. The club ran happily in its new home for many years with the club having a strong junior and senior section winning medals all over the country. </p>
    
    <p>The opportunity to expand arose again with next door becoming vacant this provided another mat area. The buildings were temporarily linked but when funds became available building work began to make them as one, this providing one large mat area and improved changing.</p>
    
    <p>Unfortunately the premises were getting old and tired with water seeping in and damp rapidly rising. The club itself was bursting at the seams with members competing all over the country winning medals both nationally and internationally. Members were getting selected for Great Britain and the club was experiencing several trips into Europe.</p>
    
    <p>The club still had the big ambitions to expand and dreamt of a purpose built Judo centre. We were applying for every grant available raising money at every opportunity.</p>
    
    <p>Several applications were put in for large grants both by the Judo Club and the Boys Club on our behalf but met with several knockbacks. In 2009 break through was made by shear hard-work, commitment and determination and we were awarded with Lottery Funding of £457k. This took everyone by complete surprise not that the club didn’t deserve it, it did, it gave us the opportunity not just to improve on our old building but to build the Judo Centre of our dreams that you see today.</p>
    
    <p>Although the judo club has had many inspirational members over the years the backbone for the club was Ray Hawkins. He set the bench mark and created the family ethos which has made the club such a great success.</p>
    
    <p>The Club continues to succeed thanks to all its volunteers who give up their time to help promote Judo and provide an enjoyable activity for the local Community.</p>
